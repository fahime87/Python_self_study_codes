1-in this project we make a random .bin file
base on college.proto --->we can make the random file by running randomData.py

2-now there is a .bin file we assume that "we recieved this encrypted file"
3-next step is reading file data
-parse data to understandable object for our program  (protoc object)
-save them in db base on models we defined in our app
--we saved about 5000 student data and 100 course data and we consider execution time
also we run the test file to convince there was no problem in saving data
